--📈 Further Improvements--

1. Improved User Feedback: Replace the native alert() with a more user-friendly notification system (e.g., toast messages or a dedicated message component) to display success, error, and loading states.

2. Enhanced Form Validation: Implement more robust client-side validation, including real-time feedback as the user types, to prevent bad data from being sent to the backend.

3. Password Complexity: Strengthen the password requirements and provide a live indicator of password strength during registration.

4. User Profile Management: Add features for users to update their profile information, such as their name or email address.

5. "Forgot Password" Feature: Implement a secure password reset flow that uses email verification.

6. Global State Management: For more complex applications, consider using a state management library like Zustand or React Context API to manage the authentication state globally, avoiding prop drilling.

7. Styling: Use a CSS framework or component library (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, or Chakra UI) for a more professional and consistent design across all components.
